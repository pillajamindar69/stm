Data driven batch
 EXPERIMENT 11
When you test your application, you may want to check how it performs the same operations with
multiple sets of data. For example, suppose you want to check how your application responds to ten
separate sets of data. You could record ten separate tests, each with its own set of data.
Alternatively, you could create a data-driven test with a loop that runs ten times. In each of the ten
iterations, the test is driven by a different set of data. In order for WinRunner to use data to drive the
test, you must substitute fixed values in the test with parameters. The parameters in the test are linked
with data stored in a data table. You can create data-driven tests using the DataDriver wizard or by
manually adding data-driven statements to your test scripts.
For non-data-driven tests, the testing process is performed in three steps: creating a test; running the
test; analyzing test results. When you create a data-driven test, you perform an extra two-part step
between creating the test and running it: converting the test to a data-driven test and creating a
corresponding data table.
The following diagram outlines the stages of the data-driven testing process in WinRunner:
