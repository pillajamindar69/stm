Database checkpoint for custom check
When you create a custom check on a database, you create a standard database checkpoint in which
you can specify which properties to check on a result set.
You can create a custom check on a database in order to:
● check the contents of part or the entire result set
● edit the expected results of the contents of the result set
● count the rows in the result set
● count the columns in the result set
You can create a custom check on a database using ODBC, Microsoft Query or Data Junction.
To create a custom check on a database:
1. Choose Insert > Database Checkpoint > Custom Check. If you are recording in Analog mode,
press the CHECK DATABASE (CUSTOM) softkey in order to avoid extraneous mouse
movements. Note that you can press the CHECK DATABASE (CUSTOM) softkey in Context
Sensitive mode as well.
2. Follow the instructions on working with the Database Checkpoint wizard, as described in
“Working with the Database Checkpoint Wizard”
3. If you are creating a new query, an instruction screen opens for creating a query.
If you do not want to see this message next time you create a default database checkpoint, clear
the Show this message next time check box.
4. If you are using ODBC or Microsoft Query, define a query, copy a query, or specify an SQL
statement.
If you are using Data Junction, create a new conversion file or use an existing one.
5. If you are using Microsoft Query and you want to be able to parameterize the SQL statement in
the db_check statement which will be generated, then in the last wizard screen in Microsoft
Query, click View data or edit query in Microsoft Query. Follow the instructions in
“Parameterizing Standard Database Checkpoints”
6. WinRunner takes several seconds to capture the database query and restore the WinRunner
window.The Check Database dialog box opens
